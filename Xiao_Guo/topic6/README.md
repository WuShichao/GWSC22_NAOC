Here are some codes about the mock data challenge. These codes are from He Wang. _demo.py_ or _demo.ipynb_ is the main program, which use the program _PSO.py_ (the python edition of PSO algorithm). After running He Wang's program, we obtain that a1=51.3605915101784; a2=28.832078856931652; a3=10.308191421692223
