Used the function defined in set3, pay attention when checking this program.
Here I give the result of one run. Be awared that dataM used an random, so the picture of it is just the refrence for this result only.
Lg1 =

   10.6069


Lg2 =

   71.4192


Lg3 =

    2.7812


LgM =

    2.3256

Here I ran this program repeatly, Lg1-3 almost don't change, and LgM remains between 0-5, so I'd say that there's a significant probability that data2 processes a signal.
Data3 is most likely a noise-only data, data1 still has a probability to process a signal.
